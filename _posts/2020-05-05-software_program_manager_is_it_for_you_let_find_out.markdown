 If you follow my blog for a while now, it is no doubt that i have covered an array of topics in relation to software programming.  As i was doing my daily recap on my last post, another Software  career came to my attention which  is closely similar to the previous Blog on Solution Architect (SA).  Software Program Manager not to be confused with Project Manager is a field in software closely related to the SA position. They are similar in that they require similar skills, certain way of thinking,  aim for close to similar outcomes. and assume a leadership role. We can think of them as  cousins originating from the same tree. Yet, one get paid way more than the other. 

*   Side-note:*  Project manager oversees individual  specific project with in a program. This role require specific tactics to operate in this role. 

What  they do:  Just like the solution architect, the program manager articulates a programs strategy and objects with emphases on the projects impact on the business while Coordinating several projects at the same time with a goal of seeing this projects to the very end.
Thus, we can assume that a program manager does not focus on completions of one project .
Project managers are responsible for bringing teams together, measuring ROI, knowing what projects addresses certain business requirements and cost analysis.

** Skills to  "THRIVE" in this role.**


**Genuine interest in People**:  
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3oKIPbNb1vWdftiVLq/giphy.gif)  Good well currency’s  as coined by “pm perspective” is the grand floor of your careers in this role. That is you as a program manager need to go out of your way to build genuine relationship with the team you work with. 
 If you dislike, or not  fond of talking, chatting, and have a true heart for people, Project management may not  be for you. For instance assume you are running late or chips are down on a project and something went wrong of which you as a manager are in need of your team working late when they are not obligated to do so,  This skill is  a club in your Program Manager tool bag as you will need to appeal to your team. On the other hand,  a lack of it means your are screwed leading to a domino effects of late projects, unhappy costumers, costumer refunds, bad costumer reviews and lost of current or potential future business. 
 
  You have to demonstrate that you GENUINELY care about people. A way of showing this is to express some interests  in your teams hobby’s,  there lives outside of works, and what get them excited. It shows that you as a Leaders are not just about the bottom line of the company, even if you are, it would be respected and there  would willingly want to follow you.  It shows that you appreciate them .

*Note:* Showing Genuine interest in people is a learnable skill. 

**Enjoy good politics:**
    while most will disagree that politics  is a bad thing at work, I actually don't think  it is a bad thing  as it can create a Healthy    working environment rather than the stepping on someone else to get up the ladder philosophy that seem to be common into coperate world , “The Good Ole Boys  Club” idea so to speak.  Simply accepting that every one at the table have there own set of objectives and which is okay. if there is a way to accomplish the main goal  while helping everyone else meet there objectives, that is a really good thing.  When done properly can create comradery. 


**Back bone/ Communication:**

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/8BkpFZg4746HEQ3rHq/giphy.gif)   This is becoming a healthy skeptic. Simply meaning don't be  “yesMan" to anything and everything. Upon the  assignment of the project, chances are not a lot of deep thinking went into the project before it was assigned to you.  Pulling back and saying wait a moment can be the difference between a success Vs unsuccessful project.While  a project can have tons of parts, the three main ones are time(duration of the project), budget (Cost),  features (minimum valuable product).  
	As a project manager, if you are not holding up a stop sign to this assignments and asking for some time to analyze them, one of this factor will go out the window and the whole project would fall flat which no one will thank you for, because the project failed leading to more time and money. 
   So when your executive manager comes  to you with a project saying, i need you to do this in this time frame, for X price, with certain features, your response should be, I will take this away to take a look at it and get back to you making sure the project requirements are realistic. 
 
**Analysis of the why and flexibility :**

   Focusing on the why behind a project is much more important than the how. Your boss may think a project need to accomplish a goal, and as a project manager it is your job to see if this new  project requirement is needed in the first place and do you have the right resources within the company to accomplish them which flows into change.
	 ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/sRJ3wPAyIxICA/giphy.gif)  No plan works on impact, thus you must be able to adopt to situation  quickly  for nothing will go as planned. Adapting and moving forward with minimum educated decision is important in this field. 

**Confidence in you decisions:** 

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/L3c8aAACw7Qpx2ojGB/giphy.gif) Being a program manager is not a “lone wolf” type of position, you know the my way or the high way mindset. But, you most be able to back up your decisions with evidence and think logical through situation . Also, getting buy-in from your team and share holder is another club in your bag that would yield tons of benefits in your career. 
	You will never have all the information in front of you line up the way you want non will you have all the stars aline for you. You have to be okay with making mistakes, owning up to them and moving on. this would play a huge part in you growth as a program manager. 

**Conclusion**:
	Project Manager role especially in a software company may seem easy to someone that was a manager at a larger company or small company. However, when it come to software related management, it is totally a different beast. Honestly, the best kind of leader you can be in this field is something called  360 leadership  coined by (John maxwell). 

  “ A 360-degree leader is someone who guides and influences their immediate team    members and becomes so respected and admired that they have influence with everyone in the organization” by "John MaxWell."
 
I hope this  is the kind of leader we all can aspire to be. 
Cheers.
