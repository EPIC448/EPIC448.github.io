        So Ruby according to some programmers supposedly is the friendliest (yes I spelled that correctly) language to learn for Coding.  I don't know about that, I mean you have Front-End Development Languages like HTML, Or CSS which is super fun to learn.  However, It Valentine day so it only fair that i talk about my affair with Ruby.  Ruby has grown on me as we started our coding affair as of August 2017 of last year in the Flatiron Course Prep.  She played hard to get and gave hard time at first as we were getting to know each other. As times goes by, we learned to accept each other strengths using our logic for the computer to understand.
 
 
***##Allow me to share several things I have learned in this relationship with Ruby.***
					 
					 
* 		    Almost everything is an expression that returns a value.  This one caught me on the side of the head because i never thought that was even possible.  Words such as  as if, until, class, and gets, just to name a few can be used in your code. I know right, MIND DESOLVED!!!  The short story is everything mean something,   where you place your quotations, or bracket or spaces within the bracket can make a different in Ruby smiling at your or Rain total hell on your through Errors or failures.


* 		  Every method returns the value of its last line of code as the value of the method though you can use return where you want to be more explicit.  You can use ruby modules as a substitute where your design requires multiple inheritance. Asin, if you have several classes or method that have similar behaviors, modules are great for this as you would be able to "inherit" those behaviors from another class using modules.

*    You can open any class again and add methods to it, called monkey patching which can be very powerful if used sensibly otherwise hell will break a.k.a loops / the world would become a blackhole, thanks to you.
   
* Ruby allow you to use block of code in any method and operate on it, e.g. in ruby world most of the time coders use iterators instead of  loops. 


*  Ruby is great in helping you to see where you went wrong so you can fix it. and It gives     a details line for the course for the error somtimes. The catch-22 is, you MUST read the error properly else, you would be chasing your own tail and don't even know it.  Yes, I'm speaking from experiences. 

* It okay to make a mistake, as the best programmer make mistakes in there code all the time. but you must be willing to fix it or else no Ruby Love for you my friend.   


Valentine's day!![](https://fthmb.tqn.com/lp5kXmjyDAll-JnVwkgf8ByejSA=/768x0/filters:no_upscale()/heart-hanging-on-an-arrow-clipart-589a02843df78caebc1d74f1.jpghttp://)
