        My love affair with coding started as a search for something better, than just the 9 to 5 schedule.  You see, most of us were thought to go to school, get a good grade, don’t piss off your teachers, graduate, collect your receipt or diploma, and work for a company for 40, 50, 60 years in hope of retirement with financial dignity. 

	    The funny thing is I drank that Kool-Aid and licked my fingers at the end of it; just to find out that all what I was thought and told does not apply in real world or in a job market.  It still puzzles how calculus 1,2,3 I spent night and day studying in college is not asked in an interview or used a job situation, but I paid thousands of dollars and study hours to learn it.  Needless to say, it was frustrating to burst you rear 4+ years to find no pot of gold at the end of that rainbow.

	    As an ambitions person, I was searching.  Then, I came upon a YouTube video and several article about remote jobs and how to go about it. As dig deeper, coding and web development were mentioned among the top 10 most satisficing occupations in the world.  So without hesitation I looked up Front End development and as I learned more about it, I was excited to learn that it is possible to work from anywhere in the world. I joined the SkillCrush web development course.  I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to keep learning.  Then, a little bird told there is Back-End development piece to this web “Thingamajig”.  So I dig up some information from reliable sources, made several calls and find out Flatiron was the place to be. 

	  In Conclusion, I know some of you are wondering, whats next after this. Well my friend, live is an adventure. Like the saying goes, "yesterday is** history**, tomorrow is a **mystery, **but today is a **gift**. That is why it is called the "**present**.” So let go on this journey together and find out where it leads us.
