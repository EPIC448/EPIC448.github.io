	  >Layout of the blue print for your house or website
	  
	  >Laydown the rooms, basements, hallways, and kitchen of the house or in case of               websites: this would be your header, footers, and sections, etc.)
	  
	  >It also has updated features such as audio, image, wrappers that helps classify                   your site and makes the content   easy to style. 
	  
	  >Furthermore, some of the  most recent syntax elements like:
	     . number, date, time, calendar, and range.
			   . graphic elements: <svg> and <canvas>.
				 . multimedia elements: <audio> and <video>.
