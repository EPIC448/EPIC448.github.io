 It is no doubt that this times is a challenging period for all especially those that are in the “job search” phase due to loss of jobs, retracted offers or recently graduated .  So the elephant in the room is what do we do then.  Will hear are couple of things that come to mind.

**Step 1  =>** *Acceptance. *Just like most gf you, I was so engraved in my daily  routine and the standard job search process of  applying online and reach out to people that I refused to accept  Covid-19 would influence my job search. The optimist professional that I am, I anticipated the passing of this virus within a couple of weeks,2 weeks at the max.  Well, that was not the case. Individually and collectively,  we need to accept that this is the world of which we live now. Rather that wait for this to change, let us think in terms of if there was no other option how are we as professionals gonna progress.   

**Step 2=>** *Re-invite our selfs*. Case in point, I am currently studying up on marketing which is outside of my career prospective. As most of us will agree that the Covid-19 will forever change the way businesses, health, and even software is conducted moving forward. Most people  will have a new career and job title by the end of this pandemic. Some ,ay argue that this is not possible. Just as the quote above mentioned, those that keep re-inventing themselves will always rip the benefit  of the new world while those that are stuck in there old ways will be super qualified for a job that does not exist anymore.  

**Step 3 =>** *Learning new skills.* I believe this stage will be organic because you as a professional will need to learn a new skill if you are to be relevant in the market place. Learning and implementing a new skill fast certainly has to be a tool in your mental kit. Else, It would be challenging for you to move forward in this new world that we are coming to. 

  Thanks for Reading.
