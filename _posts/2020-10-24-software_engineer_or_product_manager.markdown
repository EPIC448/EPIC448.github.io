 This is for some of us out there, that you have battled between product management vs Being a developer.   Trust me I know that feeling all too well.  It is like you are letting go a part of you for the other.  While this may sound like a copout, but the fact is whatever works for you is best.   Let me explain, 

After a mind-numbing amount of coding, courses and a slate burn out, I didn’t want to see another line of code, a web app or anything at all.  Which is normal for someone in the software developer realm. However, I got curious, and started wondering how I can combine my previous experiences in leadership, research, psychology, and my newly learned coding skills into one. 

After a couple of weeks of reading, research, virtual chats and so on, I came up on Product management. While this article is not to sway you here or there, but rather to give insight on both side of the table and figure out which of the two gets your juice flowing. 


 **Basics**

**Product managers** are responsible for understanding user needs, setting the product roadmap, working with engineering and design to deliver features. You are ultimately accountable for the product's success or failure. You are the CEO of the product in basic terms.

**Software Engineers** are responsible for building and shipping software. This might be for a user facing product or back end infrastructure. You are accountable for the quality and rate at which you ship as well as the scalability, performance and reliability of your code.





**Dive Deep**

  Based on my research combined with personal chats with current and former professionals in both roles (Software developers and Product manager) there is a strong interaction between these two roles, though their job description seem worlds apart. What’s interesting however is that their duties vary based on company size, products, product market, and personality.

To help Simplify your decision, here are some highlight on both sides depending on several factors that you may want to consider. (I.E, Company size and company resources etc.)


##  **Quick Overview:**

#### Software Engineer

***	Small Company***



![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlRGNpqop4Ghp7i/giphy.gif)

**	Pros**


I.	You choose how you want to work, as long you get your projects done by due date your fine. [This also, depend on your relationship with your superior in within the company].

II.	Constant access to cutting-edge technologies is certain and the ability to change product quickly or as needed due to a short or non-existing chain of command when decisions needs to be made is common. You may be working alongside the CEO.

III.	 Working in a small setting gives the opportunity to working with very smart people as everyone on-board is at a high level in their fields.

IV.	By default, you would be involved in different project simultaneously. There is no way around it, expending your skill sets. 

V.	Opportunity to explore other careers outside of what you were hired for is sure.


	**Cons**


I.	Lots of unpaid overtime and coffee.  When a product has a due date, you better tell Granny Sarah, you are not coming to her 86th birthday because you will be working or help fix the bug in that last feature.

II.	 There is “No job security” including the CEO. (That is not a typo). While Start-up are exciting, the company you work for is in constant competitions with other organization such as yours. And in most cases serving the same costumer.  Don’t even get me started on customer retention issues and marketing. 

III.	No room for learning or mentorship as you are expected to be proficient coming into the start up. Though you get to rub shoulders with top people in different fields, little to few of those individual are willing to spend their weekends teaching you JavaScript or mockup with a major feature launch date around the corner. You must take initiative for your professional growth. 

IV.	There is less room for error when creating a product especially when it can be prevented. 

V.	Commitment to the product and company may require several months with no pay, especially if you are on the founding team. Adults living like college student to self-fund their start-up are common than you think in this space.  Which is a great thing. It teaches delayed gratification.


***On the Flip Side Large company (5000+ employees)***

	**Pros**


I.	Learning by association.  Opportunity to learn from other senior Developer. During Moment such as code review is a great time to pick up little tips and tricks that you may be missing. 

II.	 Established code base(Legacy code). While coding an MVP can be fun sometimes, it also lends its self to bugs in the code base. However, at a larger company the code base is already set and ready to go.

III.	In comparison of your abilities to others within the organization, you may be will respected in your skill set. But when working in a big company, it allows you to work alongside those that are better than you and in most cases more experienced in said skill set.

IV.	Job security. Unlike the job insecurity I described early. Companies at this stage are established with extra cash to burn to keep you around for a good while, even in a bad month.  This also depends on several other factors ( i.e. Covid19).

V.	No Weekend work. Your time is set, and you are to stick to it.  Situation may arise where you need to work some extra hours, But for the most part, you would run a regular 9-5.


	**Cons**


I.	Less room to explore other interest with-in your career (this depends on the company).  The same thing that makes a Large organization great is the same thing that can cause it downfall. which in this case, you as an employee were hired for a specific skillset. So, don’t even think about going outside your little assigned box.

II.	Chances of advancing to a CTO level within 3 to 5 years in the same company is slim to non. Except if the person in the position you aspire to in a company retired, leaves the company or fired, got a promotion, or die. The chances of you getting that CFO, CTO title is super slim.

III.	Less room for innovation or creativity.  A lot can be said here, however large companies have there set ways of accomplishing a goal that has worked for years. Your 1-2 ideas are not goanna change that anytime soon. 


### Product Manager


***	Small Company***

**Pros** [including All other Pros from Software developer Small company Pros section]

I.	 By default, you will wear many hats as a PM.  There is little time and a lot to be done. Thus, just like the software engineering side of this, you will be participating in different area such as design testing, and QA with-in the same company. Simply put, this is trial by fire.

II.	Ability to make fast changes as needed. With costumer needs on the rise, you as product manager can recommend resources and get a faster responds vs large company where you need to walk the chain of commend to get approval. 

III.	You get to create a new Product from scratch.  This is your first-born in the product world. It is a rush to know that what you create would set up this company for many years to come. Assuming your product is good among other factors.

IV.	There is an Increase chance of promotion as the company grows assuming the company is profiting. Since you are in a startup and have worked on different skills sets. You get dips on different job titles and duties. 

V.	Your co-workers become close friends. Due to the small team and wishes of success on the product, a feeling of camaraderie is born.

VI.	You get a chances to interact with the costumer. Due to the small size of the organization. You often make good friends on the job.

**	Cons **
 [including All other Cons from Software developer Small company Pros section]

I.	Expect a very low compensation for all of the work you do. When you are on a product team, You can expect to conduct research, define your user personas, , design it, and code it up (sometimes ). 

II.	You have multiplied metrics to keep tabs on at all times. (i.e. User and revenue metrics) If your small company sells not just one product but a portfolio of products, you are also likely to be responsible for several or all of them at the same time.

III.	Can be overwhelming if not properly prepared.

IV.	Report to CEO (If your personality with CEO is not compactable, that is not good).


***	Large company (5000+ employees)***

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlvuvDVBwUc8awo/giphy.gif)

**	Pros**


I.	You would have more specific roles responsible for a single product and a few metric t measure because you would be  on a team most likely. 

II.	More pay in most cases. Again, larger companies can keep you around for a while.  

III.	Opportunity to Learn from other PM. No man is an island, just by the fact that you are working in a group, you will learn a thing or two.

IV.	Less overtime on most cases. Yes, you may not have to work weekends on thanksgiving. 

**	Cons**


I.	Less opportunity to talk with costumers. By the fact that you are working within a large company on a team, there are other people that are fulfilling this role. More often then not, your hands are filled with your job duties. 

II.	No Flexibility to explore other careers within the company.  Again, this depends on the company, however, you would not be doing marketing, design, and coding for a product as there are other people doing those duties. You would certainly be in constant meeting with the people in those roles.

III.	 There is an established chain of command before you can get to the CEO. Thus, decisions making takes a while longer due to getting approvals from several superiors. 

IV.	Your niched skill set may be valuable to your current company in a specific role, but if the company goes south, your career may go with it. Else, you pick up other skills outside your regular duties before such ending comes to your career.


    While this is not an extensive list, it is just a glimpse to what await you on the other side.  Both roles are awesome opportunities to explore and no matter what you choose, I believe you would do great because you have your reasons.
		
		
 ENJOY.
