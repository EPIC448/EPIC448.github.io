		 Allow me to answer that for you… EVERYTHING.  So here is the scooper I spent roughly about 50 hours on this project… I know, way to long for a project. My other blog details what the project is about. This blog is so more on the events leading up to the big day a.k.a CLI review project which is 3/7/2018, 5pm EST.
   
  I had a blast completing the project and it was a lot of fun. However, it seem like everything unrelated to the project went wrong. So from 5 am from the night before, I got a notification on my phone about a weather storm coming and I said cool. I thought nothing of it till about 12p on the big day.  The weather hit, and the light where going in and out. Also, like every programmer know, no electricity = no Internet which means no review for CLI project. 

  Like that was not enough, I decided to clean up my project a little more to mak it more users friendly. Then a method broke of which it seems like I could not get a fix to it. And like some of you that may have encounter this, The Technical coaches where not allowed to help at all.   WHAT IS HAPPENING!!!! 

 The moment of truth arrived 5pm EST, with the Internet going on and off, I persisted through the meeting and at first it was gut wrenching as I thought to myself. I don’t what to give the impression of being unprepared.  Even with how prepared I was, the internet went of line in the midst for explaining my project. I emailed the 1:1 coach and she was very understanding of the situation.  Bless her heart.


 The skinny of the story is that you would face challenges in life including coding. Also, no matter how prepared you are, something would always surface at the last minutes. What is important is how you deal with it is everything.  Here are some tools that I truly prepared me for event such as this.  The 3 Ps formula.



Proper Prior Planning => Prevents =>-Poor Performance.

Cheers to the future prepared you.
