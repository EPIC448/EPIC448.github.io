          Gone are those days of which the best developers are the guys in the corner of a basement, running code through a server with his glasses up his nose. Some of the best developer I have meet in my programming journey are what can be referred to as the New Age Developer. This kind of developer cannot be labeled or stereotyped even if you try. Case in point, a buddy of mine who is data engineer by nature enjoys the outdoors, Netflix, and a talented Bachata dancer. 

         Another case study is my self. When I was new to the development world, I assume only “Nerds” do computer work. Till my computer broke and I find myself dishing out thousands of dollars to some guy to fix my computer. As we conversed, it turns out he makes website as a side hustle. The last profession i would consider him to be in. He defies all things computer Nerd. As i got to know my new friend, it turns out that he goes bike riding with friends, hangout at the beach and of a Samoan heritage. I can't say for you, but none of the above fit the computer geeky stereotype i had in mind.

         Of course, I queried him about the cost of making a website. Without missing a beat he responded, it's only $5000. I almost fill over from my chair with puzzled look of amazement. A light bulb went off as I piece together that fact that my new computer friend can make $5000 dollar in a weekend as a developer and you can't even tell he makes that type of income as he is a regular looking guy with saddles who enjoy hanging with friends and family like my self. 

        Back to the subject. Developers cannot be “grouped” or stereotyped because as we all have lives and of different background. However, some of the best developers I have met were moms, soccer player, MMA fights and many much more, but there all seem to have several common traits.

**Characteristics of a New Age Developer: **

1. Does not know it all. All true developer can testify that they get stuck once in a while too. No one person knows it all. And the sooner you understand this. You open up a world of endless possibility. 

2. Ask for help. Trust me, this was a bit of a challenge for me as I have a science back ground. As a lab rat, what you know is what you know and no one questions you. However, for a true developer, asking for help goes a long way in your learning. 

3. Be okay with the unknown. Only if I had a dollar for every time I attempted to find out how each “gem” in my app work. I would possible payoff my college student loan in 3 months. Listen “SHERLOCK”, someone else did the heavy lifting for you”, let it be. Don't try to demystify every problem or gems.

4. 10-12 hour daily coding is a Myth. The Human brain is not a machine, thus it needs to rest. In my case, I code a total of 3-5 hours daily except Sunday, and that with a job and growing a business outside of learning to code. I had to break my sessions into 25 minutes code session, 10 minutes break. I actually understand the information more and connected the pieces easily. It seems your are doing less daily, but in the long run, you actually gain deeper knowledge with understand long term and your future self would thank you for it.

5. Passion for problem solving and teamwork. I can't even tell you how much joy this type of personality brings to the work place. People that are “solution seeking” earn more in their lifetime, and tend to be happier in every area of their lives. Science research proofs this and from personal experience, this is very true. 

6. Health and Wealth is key: This type of developer take care of the #1 thing their have health. You see most people spend their life chasing wealth and neglecting their health. Then, they spend the rest or whatever is left of their life using the gained wealth to chase their health. Often it is too late. I’m not saying to be a triathlon athlete or a gym rat. I am highly suggesting that we all can do better with our Health. If you adhere to your health, you provide better service, products, and overall holistic health thus leading to increase of wealth, which would be a nice cherry on top.
