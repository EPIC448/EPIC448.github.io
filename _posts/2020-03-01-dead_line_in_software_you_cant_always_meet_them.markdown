Over the years, I have never met anyone striving to accomplish a major undertaking that finished right on the deadline. This might be due to innovations, errors, life event etc. However, I have learned that anything worth doing and building will always take time be it a project, building a house, marriage, building muscle or weight loss.  What does that got to do with software !!!!  Will I am glad you asked. 

Often, when I explained software development to my non-coder friends, I tell them it is just like a tailor using the already created materials, tools, and some innovation to create something new, and software is no different. On the flip-side, we often don’t hit target died-line as developer.

Coding in software take a lot of complex thinking to make the process very simple. Your job as a web developer is to anticipate a lot of moving part such as: what the server will be doing, what responds do you get when you make a AJAX requests, what the user will see, and what language to use. This part may seem easy to do, but often take days if not weeks to get them to work together. And it might still not function as expected.  :)

Some Issue that were un-anticipated may crop up such as: but not limited to:

 New development may come up -[such as update to the Stack, Legacy code, and server]

Client changed there mind - [ Your temporary boss A.K.A client, can and often would change they mind wanting a different feature on the project] .. SMH  ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/EriPNV1whwKac/giphy.gif) , seriously.

Bugs/ Debugging [This is when your code decide that its gonna make you act weird in public as you attempt to talk through “rubber-duck” your code often leading to being  labeled as “crazy girl at Stack-bucks” that talks to her computer]. Yes…. that’s a real thing. 

 Life get in the way [trips to aunt shelly and uncle Bob’s wedding and as flower girl you cant miss, emergency trip to the doctors because  your dog broke its tooth going through your garbage, or my favorite your Dog  shit the house because you forget to take little Jack for a walk in the morning]. This will question any human being sanity for sure.

Internet / computer crash/ Slow wifi  [Every developers and college student Night mare] No Explanation Needed.

 School is the only place google is not allowed on a research paper to solve a problem. In the developer world, Google, Stack Overflow, and documentations are your bread and butter. USE THEM.

 Committing your code to Github often is another life saver, this ensures that your work is backed up to the virtual control center a.k.a The Cloud for developers in lame term. 

Save project in a Hard drive (flashDrive) because flappy desks are dead.   I know, OMG!!! I cant believe i actually had a collections of those. SMH.  

 Frequently update your clients and review the process you agreed on . This can not be overstated. Simply put, If you want to grantee that you get paid with minimal headache as possible, Take the time to update your client or clients each step of the project. 

Keep the end product in Front of you.  If the project was drawn out on a wireframe for instance, Make sure that you are referring back to that wireframe  to complete the task.  The last thing you want to do is create a totally different result that what was agreed up on. 

 I hope this helped. I want to hear back from you. what are your thought concerting this matters. 

See you on the Flip Side.
