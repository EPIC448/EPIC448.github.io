This blog is based on my personal observation in regards to  Covid-19 and Job search.
 It no secret that closing of stores and offices makes it challenge to physically  job search and even attend meetup let alone get interviews. To add salt to injury, thousand of people were fired due to the lack costumers leading to closing of business.
 
Thus, bringing business owner  to a fork in the road of  keeping employees or letting them go to keep the doors open. BY default,  online application process is unprecedented at this moment as millions of people  that were let go are looking for a job. This make it harder for graduates like myself to standout in a sea of online applicants. All this leads me to ask question as a Flatiron School graduates, What can I be done to put myself in the best position for a job since we all are isolated at the moment.

 This are the couple of tips i picked up form several expert 


* Schedule out you days even down to the minute if possible. 

*  Online application is at it worst as allotted to above. Using personal  connections through LinkedIn, family members, Zoom chats and attending Webinar is a great tool to stand out during this times as you will have a better chance of being referred to someone else through a connection.&#x2028;	
*  Practicing your coding skills becomes more important than ever as you will be completing against new graduates and veteran in your field . This is best done by building a value validation project. This is a project simply indicating to your future employer with you can do and are will to do for the company.
*  Showing empathy to your Hiring manager . In your communication, highlight the fact that you understand this are challenging times and hope them and there family are save.
*
* Listen to the fine print. (look at companies that are Hiring right now, Know what company you truly want to work for and do a deep research on the company.  I.E, Question such as : What is there costumer base, what are there costumer saying, How are there growing in the marketplace,  etc )
