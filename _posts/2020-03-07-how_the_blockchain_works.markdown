 Picture a spreadsheet for a Delivery chain. When an Order is placed, In most cases that spreadsheet is updated by a person or a group of people that are authorized to the spreadsheet which is often stored in a location on the Server.  This allow for  problems such as : Server crashes, Hackers access, Change of code, and Often cost of using a third party.


 In regards to blockChain, imagine a spreadsheet that regulates itself across multiply Network. So when are order is placed. A carbon copy of that order is created and each node in the blockChain holds a copy.This is BlockChain. In other words, Information is held in a shared and continuing reconciled database thus, hacker can’t corrupt the code because of discentralization.  The information is hosted by millions of computer simultaneously across the network making  BlockChain transparent with the ability of storing the data cryptographically . 


 
 
*** Long Term solution to Lots of Issues by BlockChain
***
 **Centralization**: Key Word I want you focus on is Central. The Normal Internet as we know it, functions on a server.  Something like this. 


indicating how a request is made. So when you type out a word  in the  search bar or shop for an item on line, upon submitting your request, the server finds it and present that information back to you on your device[i.e Cellphone, tablet, computer]. This has severed us well over the years, however, it has its challenges such as: 

*  . All data are stored in one spot making an easy target for Hackers.
* . During Upgrade,  all request would have to hold
* . If there was a power outage that affect the server, no one can access there information. 
* 
You see that is why Decentralization is the future because the information is not stored in one place, rather everyone on the network has a copy of the information needed. 

 
**Transparency**:

Some might be concern that the Blockchain is secure or does it expose all our information.  With BlockChain  each user has public address and a private address disallowing your personal information to be shared. In a real scenario  assuming you sent Bitcoin to a person as a method of payment, the transaction does not come up as “John sent 3 Bitcoin”,  Instead,  John’s Blockchain address is represented on cryptography and will show up as "1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2" sent 3 Bit-cone. As a result, your personal information is not exposed. 

 However, In case of companies currently  using or will be using BlockChain,  It is possible that company will be sharing with there share holders and costumer how money and transaction are made as the companies public blockchain address would be available to there costumers.  This encourages transparency among companies and there clients incase in point banks and mortgage companies. 


**Immutability**:  Simply means unable to be changed. This is what makes Blockchain so reliable.  Every import comes into the blockchain through smart contract as a hash specifically  Bitcoin SHA-256  as of the time of this writing which may change in the future.  Each hash point to a Block in the BlockChain.  No matter the length of your input, the 256-bits length hash is establish. And assuming you go back and change the Hash, the BlockChain algorithm spit out a totally different Hash pointing to a different Block in the chain making it impossible to be altered even by Hackers. 

 For better explanation, check below by Ameer Rosic of Navigation quoted: 
“
 Imagine this for a second, a hacker attacks block 3 and tries to change the data. Because of the properties of hash functions, a slight change in data will change the hash drastically. This means that any slight changes made in block 3, will change the hash which is stored in block 2, now that in turn will change the data and the hash of block 2 which will result in changes in block 1 and so on and so forth. This will completely change the chain, which is impossible. This is exactly how blockchains attain immutability.“

   
 Our next post in the Series will be Peer-2-Peer networking in BlockChain.
