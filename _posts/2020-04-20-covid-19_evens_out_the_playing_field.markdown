Yep, you red that right.  I can hear the mob forming on the Horizon already. What do you mean we are all equal now during this job search, I paid my dues , climb the corporate ladder and did 20 years in  “x" company. While you're years of service may to true and believe me I understand your perspective  to a degree. However, based on the current situation,  we are all equal. 

 Whatever level you see yourself in the job market place Entry, Mid  Senior or otherwise, You have a shot at getting a job in the market place. keep in mind this is easier said than done, but it is doable.  Here is just a few evidence I am see in the market place currently that support this theory:
   
> ** Old mindset:**

  Most brick and Mortar company, ma and papa store may have amazing track record that has worked for years with an outstanding costumer retention rate. While this may make the share holders of the company or business owners very happy, companies that refused to plan for the future find themselves backed into a corner during this times. Its no secret that  Covid-19 shot down all operation meaning no face to face interaction with costumers or work ins. For that small local business owner, this means no profit for the day. 
The lesson here is that companies and business owners that refuse to adapt lost a good percentage of there business and that trend is not slowing down. This resulted in layoffs and broking coffee mugs. 
 Leading to both seasoned Veteran and the new graduate competing for the same job. 


** > Technologically, you're behind:**

This easily ties back into the last paragraph.  Companies that refused to upgrade there companies hardware and software are filling the pain during this times as there are not able to keep up with  the demand of the new economy  of Covid-19. Due to people staying at home and working from home, most streaming & internet services are updating there software and Hardware constantly.
Assuming your employer sells or render services on internet.  If you find your self in this position where your Home computer is faster than your employers IT system or stack, Can you imagine how the costumer looking to buy from your company most feel. Thus the company lose online buyers because of lack of implementation of the  latest technology. It is estimated that the average online shopper attention span is about 15 seconds and even less if your online  presence suffers from latency.


**> PJ workflow:** 

    Most of us with kids, pets or without seem okay at managing our time. I think I can speak for most of us as our morning starts out with, waking up, start the coffee machine, microwave something for breakfast, jump in the shower, dress up and off to work you go escaping the yelling and screaming of the kid or pet with assurance that your partner or whomever you  share the residence with will take care of the rest.  Not no more. 
Most people are working from home now. Professionals are realizing more than ever the importance of waking up early and getting as much done as possible before the kids or pets wake up.  And for some, the early morning workout is the most important time to focus and get things done..


** >  The Invisible Nancy:**
   In 3rd grade we often play the game freeze tag. And i was really good at it. However, my nemesis Nancy was better. It seem like she can’t be touched no matter how much myself and the whole class try. No one in the whole of 3rd grade could catch this girl in freeze tag. So we named her invisible Nancy.  Just like Nancy, some of us still think we are invisible to Covid-19.  Then you have the other side of the coin. Such as myself that are paying attention to the news and listening to expert. It is evident that more people are paying close attention to there eating habits,  and even workout since there are home with family. In other words, more folks are coming to the realization that there health is the best asset you can have, for without it nothing else works.
