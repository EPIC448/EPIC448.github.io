 Be it project, building features, and or hitting a deadline, there are significant levels of stress that occurs  with software development . Both on the engineering role and  Product role .  

This blog propose a  Software Engineer perspective.

Let jump into it.

###   Stress in your code.
	
* When you have more bugs than code in your project.
 Having couple of bugs in your code is understandable to a level. However, when  repeated   errors are occuring  on the same or  similar situation within your code.  This is a clear sign that stress is at play among other things. 

* you dread the site of a computer terminal or anything that resemble a documentation of  sometype.

* Solving simple code task seems like a chores.
* And talking about code seem a mundane  task.

rapid breathing,  high blood pressure, risk of heart attack, erectile dysfunction, tense muscles etc.  The list here would certernaly impair your coding abilities. 

### How to manage Stress?   

  Just like anything, it starts with you.
 
*   Perfectionism cause anxiety.

 Software developement by it nature requires nauseating level of details especially if your a developer thus the need for perfection.  There are several ways to manage this.
 First, plan out your project from start to finish before writing a single line of code .
 Secondly, implementing Test Driven Development(TDD)  is a tool in software development that would save you time and headache when refactoring now or in the future. 

*  Working too much within a short duration.

 A good amount of programming related tasks requires problem solving with your frontal lobe which means the brain is involved.   If your main job is code related and your side hustle is code related, you are asking for  a burn out.  Either you acknowledge it or not, your brain is working in overdrive and overtime.  It's working beyond its allowed capacity at an intense rate for a long time. Picture revving a car engine past the red line, it would blow at some point. In our analogy, your brain would not explode, but your capacity to solve problems will,  leading to more frustration.

 * Monitor your emotions.

When you're feeling negative or not at your best due to situations within or outside your control, Save your work and walk away from the computer for a while. Yes, including your cell devices. Go complete a small task like washing the dishes or rearranging that garage cabinet you had intentions of doing for the last 6 months. You will come back refreshed. 

 * Meditation ,walks, yoga

 This is straightforward. However its effect spans beyond dropping a couple of pounds, it helps to clear the mind when done mindfully. I can testify to this personally.
 
 * Understand your sweet spot for productivity a.k.a "The Zone".

 We all have had the proverbial bad code day in development. When it  just seem like nothing is going your way. I have felt this more times than i can count. 
  A solution that has worked for me and several others is to   set a timer and make sure your are up and moving every 15 minutes when working on a project. 
	This serves 2 purposes in most cases. You solve problems better when you walk away from the computer as you will be motivated to finish the work and  secondly you are not  "revving" your brain pass the redline in relation to the car analogy mentioned earlier.

* Revisit why you decided to do this. 
 The reality for most is that, it is  a path to a better life and passion for creativity.

 We are all human, which means we are susceptible to burnout especially on extra long
Projects or when it seems like nothing is  working the way we want it to.  This is where revisiting why you get started is a most have tool in your motivational tool kits. Starting with the end in mind is great, but more often than not, re-visiting the  expected end can do wonders for you in your journey.

*  Find a way to make it very enjoyable.

Find a way to make it enjoyable. Here is  where you can set the way you want to work and learn. From speaking with other developers and  Product Managers with a software background. When working on a project and you feel stuck. Sometimes, a code along or pair programming may be just what the doctor ordered. And in times like this of which everyone work  remotely, it is very nice to speak to another human.

 * Cut back on stimulant.

To all my coffee drinkers and Starbucks warriors, cut back on the coffee.  While I am not a coffee drinker, science has shown that compounded stimulant use can lead to burn out. I am not asking you to throw out your coffee maker or protest as starbucks. Simply take a week or two off the coffee.  
I am aware that there are other stimulants out there like aderiole. Please check with your Doctor or a professional regarding your situation. 

 In conclusion,  code does not exist in a vacuum except if you live on the moon. Till then, we are all humans on earth and living our lives to the best of our abilities and part of that is stress.  We can not  get rid of stress in software development totally, but we can do our best to manage it.
