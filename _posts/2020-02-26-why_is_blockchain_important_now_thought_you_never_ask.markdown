Few Reason. 

The content of your blog post goes here.


*  It is not regulated, Meaning there is no central authority that govern the system. Democratized system which mean there are no secrets. In a real world situation, every transaction  conducted in the said network are visible to all in the network to see. By default, everyone is accountable for there actions. No, for some of you that your worried about senstivie information, each user has a public and private key unique to there identity, thus your personal information is save. More on this later. 

*  No transaction cost and Verification:  BlockChain system allows the  save passage of information between the networks creating blocks which is verified by million of computers connected to the blockchain around the Global  stored on the net with a one-of-kind record of history across all the nodes in the network. Thus, making falsifying a single record impossible. 
 
 In lame term, every computer connected to the BlockChain keeps a record of documents stored on the network. Thus, if  a user intend to use the blockChain for  negative purpose then intended, Once this the said user creates  their smart contract and submitted on the blockChain. Other nodes with there blockChain is gonna “vote or review “ the submitted smart contract. And If its “votes" fall in the negative, It would not 
be added to the blockChain, thus rejecting the contract.

*  Because of the peer-to-peer nature of BlockChain, transaction are free. This means, that we don't have to pay for things like transaction fee at the Bank or ATM, or  Train tickets or Plane ticket because the middle man is removed which in this case are the fee processing companies, even the huge ones like PayPal.
