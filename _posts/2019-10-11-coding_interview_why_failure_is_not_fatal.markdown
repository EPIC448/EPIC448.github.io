I took the Drop-Box code challenge in JavaScript. Before the test, I was a little concerned and worried about my performance because JavaScript is a language re-learning, thus it felt so new. Just like any good student would, I prepared the best I could and practiced my ass off for it. Yes that included reaching out to some of my JavaScript dedicated developer friends and YouTube videos the whole-nine. With high hopes I approached the code challenge and did not pass. Honestly, It hit me like a ton of bricks for couple of hours as I thought that I put my best foot forward, but to no avail. This was the perfect catalyst for this blog post - “failing a coding challenge is not fatal”. 

 Backstory
Relearning and understanding Javascript was a challenge. Fresh off a Ruby on Rails project  and getting right into JavaScript may not be the best way to learn a new programming language. I didn’t grasp the concepts as well as I thought I did. And one could ask, “if you’re good with Ruby on Rails, why not take the code challenge with what you are familiar with?” Of which I would respond: success is outside your comfort zone. I have always enjoyed a challenge and since JavaScript seem to be my challenge in the moment and knowing the impact it has in the marketplace, I felt the need to test my knowledge in javascript with a real job coding challenge. 


Not a Fan
Needless to say, I am not a big fan of the coding interview challenge process because it requires a potential employer  to sniff out error in a potential candidate code which in my opinion is not the best way to build a productive relationship in a work setting. I feel the eye rolls already, lol. Some will argue that it is important for an employer to test the candidate’s capability to perform their duties before coming on board which is understandable. However, as an educator in the Fitness and Health realm, it’s like telling a potential client to perform Jumping jacks, sit-ups, and Burpees for 20 reps each before we take them into our programs in an attempt to dispel their confidence. Honestly, it builds an ”US” against “THEM” mentality and dynamic in the workplace. And to add, some people are great at “Faking it till you make it”. So potential candidate may be good test takers  then there get in the company, then it is all downhill. Furthermore, I am not a big fan as it limits the full knowledge of a person. It is impossible to draw a conclusion about an individual's  ability to program based on a “code Challenge” at a specific point in time. However, most companies do it to prove a point and test an individual knowledge. Still not the most effective method to test a person’s knowledge. With that said, I welcome interview code challenges as some companies require it as part of their hiring process due to the culture of the organization. As a professional, I encourage aspiring developers to do what works for them. However, I belief there is a better solution to this. 

Better Alternative

 An effective method that will yield a positive impact in cultivating employer and employee relationships would be to have potential candidates talk through a project they’ve  worked on and possibly recommend they add a new feature to that project in a pair coding or on-site coding session. 

Another method would be to have the potential employee do their homework by reading over the candidate’s GitHub account or blog to get a better understanding of potential candidate’s development throughout programming journey(or) potential’s candidate’s programming journey.

These recommendations fufill certain objectives for the employer and candidate:
 For The Employer 
• Highlights candidate’s ability to think through projects and problem solve. 
• Candidate’s ability to adapt to the situation
 • Candidate’s ability to work in a self-driven environment and team setting 
• A look into a candidate’s mindset on solving problems.

 For The Candidate:
• Ability to accept positive feedback
•Cultivate positive relationship between themselves and their potential future employer
• Get a better grasp on what it’s like to work at the company. 

In conclusion, the purpose of an interview is to check if there would be chemistry between an employer and employee. And accurately vet a candidate based on their knowledge. Code challenges  shortchange this goal and  hinder the ability to uncover any potential  chemistry between the employer and the potential future employee as it creates this dynamic of “US” vs “THEM” referred to earlier. As a result, this may lead to candidate not being able to highlight their creativity, hiding past  mistakes, and an atmosphere of distrust which often leads to low number of retention rates and high cost of re-hiring and training to employers.
