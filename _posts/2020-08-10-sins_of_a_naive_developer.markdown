   When it comes to software development, no one is holier than thou. However, some of us have went through this phase in our careers or currently going through this process. Fact of the matter is, you don't know what you don't know.  The article addresses some pitfalls faced as a new developer.

## Not planning your code##
 
Over the moon with the different avenues you could take  in your new engineer role, accompanied with a rush mixed emotions you accepted your first project.
With fire in your eyes, you proceed to open your console to code.  Then the reality of  time pressure and due dates sets in as you code along with no plan.

This is referred to as putting the cart before the horse, you started coding on the fly with the naive presumption that you will figure it out as you go. Facts: This often lead to bad news.  Yes, I am speaking from experience.  What new developer often disregard in this case is the possibility of a new feature  or requirement that you may need to include down the road, or accounting for the time required to debug your written code. 

 **Solution**

 Contrary to popular belief, you are not just a machine that turn coffee into code. You are a human thus you most ask questions.
 
  **Example**

 * What is the minimum valuable product(MVP)?
 
* Why this project and feature ?

* Who are the end users of this project ?

* Why use a certain language for the code ?

* Are you working with legacy code ?  

* What is the timeline for the project ?

And run your written down questions and perceived answer by a senior engineer or mentor to get some insight and help to keep you on track.  Often than not, this would help you structure your code even for future needs. 
   
   

## Misunderstanding MVP(Minimum Valuable product ##
 
*“What gets us into trouble is not what we don't know. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so.”
 - Mark Twain. *

   Based on what we are told, the brains tend to draw conclusion based on limited information. This go double for a new developer. As a new developer,  we often assume a users wants vs a user needs which are 2 separate tasks. 
  As a newbie more often than not, You would have limited access to the  future user of your product as  you are working  through the learning  phase of your career which is all good. Don't get down on yourself because those senior  engineers that have access to a user sometime mess-up this role as well. Often, consumers or users  can’t distinguish between what they want vs what they need. As a result, a user can miscommunicate  what they think they want and what they truly want.  So you can get by with a little  correction.

  **Solution**
	
  Book a coffee with Users  experience  experts or Designer. By default there  job is to talk to the users of your product and understand the user inner working / Mindset. Seek for there insights on the matter, it is invaluable to your career. 
  Also, Testing a prototype in the market place is another valid option. Get scrappy, and get something in the market that you can run as a sample, Then refine and refactor. 
 
## Debugging ##

   Before I lay my hands on a key board to code  in an online class of 25+ people. A software engineer instructor  said to us "You would spend your programming life time debugging than writing code”. 
Of which my naive self responded …. “Bullshit”, I came here to create and that is the end of the story.

 Publicly admitting I was wrong, she was right.  I can estimate for every 1 hours of code written, you can anticipate 2-3 hours of debugging  as  new developer. It's it not to scary you rather it is to empower you for the next level in your career. This is just the reality. Every company that use software has a quality assurance department of which their job is to find bugs in your code.

    **Solution**
		
 Planning out your code work reduce tons of error, and creating test cases along the way would save you a ton of headache in the debugging phases. Debug,Debug,Debug!!! Using the “rubber ducky”.
   Understanding each line of your code by talking out loud is very helpful.  Attempt recreating the code with a bug, so you can  reverse engineer the issue and solve it.
  
	Don't be too proud to  get help, No man is an island. if you're on a good team, they would assist your through this process.
	
	
	
 ## Tech Update/ education ## 
 
Referring back to the last paragraph, no man is an island, thus you dont know it all.  Also, software seem to change every 30-60 days at this point. As a novice, it may seem over whelming as you are getting your feet wet in a  company, learning there frame work, completing the  on boarding process etc. Leverage every one and everything around you to accelerate your learning curve. This can literally change your career.

**Solution**

   Your Spare time are GOLD in disguise. There is only so much hours in a week, but i can tell you from first person experience, spending 4 HR a week, an estimated (45 minutes a day)  would make a difference in your learning as new software  engineer and not to mention you can flex and express your cognitive acrobatics as a fast learner. 

## Working on Legacy Code##

   The Mother load pain  of most developer existence. Honestly, this is something you have little or no control over. 
Reasons for this include but not limited to:
 Author of the code is not at the location anymore, old technology or the author of the code is too busy working on other project even if they are still on site thus, you can’t seem to get a hold of them. You cant control this.

**Solution**

 Realize that you have being dealt a hand that you have little control over, thus  you can seek help  from a colleague that you perceive as willing to help.  Book a coffee time with the author if there are still on site.  Reading the code and understanding each line to your best ability would help a ton and taking notes in the process . 
Refactor only as needed. You don't want to rename a function in the legacy code and break everything. It would not  be an awesome day for you if this happens.
