  Note that we all react differently to stress as this post is different from some the Technical/future aspiration that this blog is geared for, stay tune. 

> *Monitor Your Input:*
  Food, fast food, news , social media,  negative conversation with friends  and family.
 It is awesome how we post uplifting / motivational quotes on social media, then when we get a chance to converse with another human, we start with the bad news in hopes that this is a way to bond as people. Let me be the first to tell you, it is getting old. The more negative input you have, the more the negative output you project to the world.  This can lead to anxiety and depression .  
“Don’t join an easy crowd; you won’t grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.” – Jim Rohn

 *Take breaks from watching, reading, listening to News.*
 It is no doubt that this are challenging times for all of us, but  as humans are still in control of certain things. You do not have to listen to the News Channel 24/7. Also, keep your kids from this gloom and doom news. Please, I am not saying lie to your little ones at home, rather I am offering a way for you as a grown up to communicate the current situation to your little ones in  healthy ways that they can understand.  Also, guard there sense gates by being the filter between what they see and  hear .
 
   It is a general thesis, that some of the big news outlets we are all aware of makes there money from negative news which improve the  rating   for the channel leading to more money for the said news outlet.  I would strongly suggest listening to experts that you trust with credibility, listen to there suggestion on the matter then draw your own conclusion as you see fit.



 *Health is wealth.*
There is no better time for you to take care of your body then now.  A 10-15 minute cardio or stretching daily can do wonders to your health especially if you are not the type that fancy exercise pre-Covid-19.  I am a person example of this, now I wake up 5:45am Monday  - Saturday to get my workout in before the day starts. This set the mood for the rest of the day for me. And I am very grateful for it. You can not manage not to have it.  More Importantly, this is an habit Im working on keeping for a long time. 



 *Learn  a skill such cooking.*
   I feel empathy for  people that don’t know how to cook in times like this because chicken fingers and drive-thru meal can not sustain you for so long. Thus, this is a great time to learn how to cook. This is a skill that can possibly make a different in your health both in the short term and long term. Why not use this moment to learn how to do it. Resources such as facebook, udemy, books, blogs and podcasts are a great source to use to learn this skill. 


* Take care of those that are important to you *. 
  Make sure that you are safe, then your family, then your community. This is one of those instances where you need to be selfish to be selfless. You are no good to anybody when you are lying down sick and non- functional . 


*Inconlusion,*
Obviously there is more to this story than it accounted for here. However, it is only right that we share knowledge amongst ourself to get better. In that spirit, I like to hear from you, what are other suggestion, tips, tricks, and opinions I left out. Looking forward to hearing from you. 

Cheers.
