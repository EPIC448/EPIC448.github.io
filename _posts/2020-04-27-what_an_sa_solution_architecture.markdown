** Intro:**  
Scrolling through Amazon job posting as they are one of the companies hiring at the moment, I came across a profession that really spiked my interest. The more I dig into this profession, the more intrigued  and  excited I got. We are talking about Solution Architect ladies and Gents.
 
**Definition of Solution architecture:** is a practice of designing, describing, and managing the solution engineering in relation to specific business problems. This is a complex role in that it bridges the gap between business problems and technology solutions.

*** It encompasses:  ***
 
*  Finding  the best solution among all possible solution to solve a business problem .
*  Communicating the structure, characteristics, behavior, and other aspects of software to   stakeholders.
* Defining features, phases and solution requirements. 
*  Providing  specifications according to which the solution is defined, managed, and delivered. 
*  

*** Role within a company: **
	As a solution Architect,  You are the glue that hold a lot of parts together including the business, software requirements and  shareholder requirements in regards to software.
Proof of a Good Solution Architect:  a well structured solution architecture helps teams develop the product on time, on budget, and ensure that it solves the problems it was designed for. Some of the responsibility of the solution architect may include:
 
*  Analyzing the technology environment

* Design a solution prototype,
* Support project management among other things.

**Background and Technical experiences:**

While most will agree that a certain number of years is needed to come into this role. I disagree with this theory. With AWS Associate Solution Architecture certificates on the rise, many professionals that are changing careers or looking to pivot into a new career are taking several months to study up for the Associate Solution Architect Exam and most are passing the exam. Thus making them valuable  to the marketplace. Please, make no mistake assuming that it is an easy exam, it is not.
  Also, as a result of Covid-19, companies such as Amazon and many others are realizing more than ever that professionals in other fields are willing to learn a new skill in a new job market.
 
A wealth of online programs and courses can be taken for these exams. Also, AWS solution architect job  are on the rise because tons of companies are moving their product and Services  to the Cloud.
 
**When Does a company need Solution Architect and Why?:**

  A lot of things can and often goes wrong during building software let alone moving a huge established software infrastructure  to the Cloud. Now you may not need a solution architect  for every challenge during a small project.  However, as soon as software engineering requirements grows or becomes  more complicated entailing an identified number of processes and risks, solution architects can do wonders in creating a solution for by crafting the proper Cloud infrastructure to accommodate the necessary business/software needs.
 
** Maximize solution  architect on your team: **
 
  Finding the right  combination of software that fits a company's ecosystem is not a task for the faint of heart. As many things could go wrong. A solution architect would be your best bet in this situation.
 Other times a solution architect would be a most valuable in a company is when there a lot of security risk present and multiple products will be implemented at the same time or if the underlying technology is not stable yet. 
 
Also, lending the ears of investors and shareholders is a big deal in the software business. A solution architect can speak to both the business side and the technology side of the room, bringing everyone to the same level of understanding. And helping shareholder understand the software aspect of the project.
 
**Conclusion:**

   Solution architecture is a really cool field that can benefit an organization. It implies looking at a software infrastructure from a 50,000 feet spectrum. Selecting and choosing the proper services that fit the organizational need.  Using a Solution architect could be the difference between a thriving company and unstable company.
