By now, some of you know finishing out a boot Camp program of which part of the Program  was to complete a JavaScript section and build an API from scratch using JSON to request data from that API. Not an easy task. As a self-taught developer, now in a boot camp, this was no walk in the park as I was only beginning to solidify the basics of JavaScript. 

 Furthermore, each chapter goes through a revision from an Expert Technical Coach followed with feedback. it felt like these coaches were out to lay wastes of your weeks of hard work, But I know there are just doing their duty to make sure we’re ready for the developer market. I went through a three-screen share code revision to pass this section. It was not fun at first.  

 So for those of you out there who may be going through what I went through to understand JavaScript, here’s a short list of what helped tremendously in the process of learning JavaScript.

1: Rested Brains: Remember as a kid when it seemed like your parent dragged you to go to bed then you grow up and find out you cant function as an adult without proper sleep. Well as a developer, multiply that feeling by 15. That’s what an UN-RESTED brain feel like as a developer. You would not be able to think efficiently through your code or even create anything of meaning because your creative machine (brain) is not functioning at maximum capacity because you chose to watch one more episode of “Game of Thrones” or hangout late at night with the boys. 
 P.S: “Why are all the Good people killed in GAME OF THRONES”

2: Mark down “Possible Knowledge Gaps” and link them back to the main topic: This is a two for one combo; you’re welcome in advance. ☺ The brain or your mind can only hold so much information, thus you most keep notes or documents of what you have learned and understood, and what you have learned that doesn't make any sense. This is important because it cuts your study time in half because now all you need to do is focus on the missing pieces in your knowledge and dive deep on those topics. As you learn the missing pieces, the mental puzzles starts to form and you can link it all back together. 

3: Patience with your learning: “Everything worth doing that will last, takes time and effort.” By Samuel.O
 To get graphic with you, after your mom and dad gave each other a “special hug”, (yes, that’s how it was explained to me by Mrs. Smith, 3th grade. Smh), You took 9 months to develop. So don’t expect to understand JavaScript in three and a half minutes. It takes time. So do not be hard on yourself, rather take small pieces at a time.

4: Reading and application: Everyone claims to be a good driver, till you get in a car with them, and realize that you had a better chance of staying alive by walking. And like me, you often wonder how the said individual got a driving license, then later to find out, they never went for a driving test, but there know every traffic sign in the driving manual (Yes, that’s a real story). The point is, You can be a well read developer, but if you don’t put code to the console or editor, all your read article knowledge is a waste of time.  Application is KING in programing. 

5: Enjoy debugging: No code is perfect. It is said that code is written once, but read over 5,000 times. As a developer you will spend your coding lifetime reading more codes than writing code. This means you better be good at debugging a.k.a problem solving. This entails understanding what the code is doing, what the code should do, and what the code will do in the future. Without those elements, you will not have a functioning code.

6: Organize your learning: “Everything in life has principle and structure “by Samuel.O.
Lawyers have Bar exams, Doctors have Medical Schools Exams, Several Religions have commandments to follow, and even your local Strip Club (depending on your location) has a bouncer and several poles. In programming, we call them conventions. At its core, coding or programming is simply a box of tools on a shelf, then choosing several tools to work together. However, those tools only work a certain way and without properly organizing and structuring the use of those said tool, it would not work. It is no different in learning a new language like JavaScript. You need to organize the information in your mind such that when you need access to it, you can activate it on command following conventions
 
Here are a few real life examples I used for this: 

 . I make sure to attend all scheduled study groups and incorporate coding block of 20-30 minutes for every 10 minutes of  break.
 . Study to understand rather than rush to the next chapter. Meaning If I don’t understand a topic, I come back to it at a later date. 
. I wrote in a study calendar for on a Bi-weekly bases focusing on topics i want to learn. 
. Took breaks in between studying to reduce eyestrain and I avoid coding in the night time. (Which relates to the beginning of this article, RESTED BRAIN).

. HOPE THIS HELPS
