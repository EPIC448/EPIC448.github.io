**Quick Recap.
**     
		 
		 In previous topics I alluded to the fact that BlockChain run on several computers called nodes. As mentioned earlier, Traditional Centralized computer all relay on a server to download information as needed. However, with a Decentralized peer-2-peer Downloading, each computers a.k.a nodes has a copy of the requested information thus taking out the centralized authority which is the server. So if you want to download something like a bank statement assessing you participate in the  blockChain , other nodes in the network has that information that you need possibly making huge server companies like Google & Amazon invalid in the future. 
 
For some who are wondering, what is a node?  I cover nodes in the previous articles, but for some of you that missed it, a node is a computer that participates in block chain network  using Ethereum or Hyperleger which are are currencies that run on the block chain.  They part-take in the network 3 ways.
  
1.Verifying the transaction by Mining	.
2. Keeping a full copy of the blockchain .
3. having a small or shallow  copy of the blockchain. 

 Furthermore, the use of networks and nodes cryptocurrencies  are becoming very huge.  Why? Cryptocurrency like Ethereum rely on proof-of-work consensus mechanism with all the nodes having almost equal privilege in the network though there function within the network may differ. The main Idea is there is no governing body that has an over all say about the currency which is true for both bitcoin and Ethereum.  

However, when a transaction occurs, the network follows the gossip protocol. Just like you nosy relative, the node that is near to where the transaction occurs get the information, and tell the surrounding nodes, and those nodes tell the other nodes. However, to keep the network healthy nodes elect a leader node or “supernodes” who oversee the network while stilling decentralized in the system .
