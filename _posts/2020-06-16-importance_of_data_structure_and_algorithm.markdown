 After few weeks of learning the bed rock of computing Algorithm and data structure.  I have come to realize why some employers seem to “get off” at using this type of testing in interviews , while some candidates have some "beef" with this type of interviewing/ testing method. Some of you that have follow thus Blog this far would say that I am a traitor by standing up for the other side. 

*hahah. Of which I response,    ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0Exq2Lxv4MQLRH6o/giphy.gif)

The reason we enjoy technology so much is that we can configure our devices in a away to do a single task repeatedly and in some cases multiple task as the same time.  Well, algorithm and proper data structure allows for this to happen. However, the question remains why do employer seem to enjoy the "Game of Throne” style of blood bath that Code Challenges and white board  testing provide.

“Hmmmm" Slow down in that assumption and let see things from a Computers perspective. 

**Background of why.**

 As humans, we have our daily routine and behaviors on how we do things (I.E,  Wash your hands before you eat, or wearing the right shoe, then the left shoe). We have this method in place as a way to “Handle" daily task, thus requiring less “Mental Band"  width to carry out the same task daily. 
 Guess what, so does your computer.  Data structure and Algorithm provide a set of techniques to the developer  helping  him/her  to write code that assist the computer in handling large data efficiently. 

  For instance, if the programmer wants to collect the  user details from a Google API, and he/she
does not  know about data structure and algorithm, he/she may not be able to write efficient code to handle the data. which can simply break your code and cost a ton of cash to the company.  As weird as it may sound, Algorithm & Data structure methodology are simple but challenging to implement . 

The good news  is that  concept of algorithm and data structure in programming does not change “NO MATTER THE PROGRAMING LANGUAGE”. This knowledge allows you to write code in any programming language with minimal effort as long as you have a fair understanding of the language syntax. It's like speaking different languages that all sourced on from a Latin heritage.

** Just a few Round Up Pointers of why employer give Code Challenges(regards to Data Structures).**


* Data structures are universal, they are fundamental building block of computer science.
* Give an advantage of changing the question to evaluate candidate logical and analytical skill.
* Performance evaluation for each approach referring to (time and space complexity ).. Insist URL.
*  Analyzes candidate approaches, evaluate performance, Problem-solving skills and clarity of thought.
* Use in software development in any position from junior programmer to manager level
* Software builds on data and deals with data.
