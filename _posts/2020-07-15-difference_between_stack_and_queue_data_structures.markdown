#  Queues
####  Layman Terms Queues.   

 There you are on a “Hot” summer day. And a friend felt your pain and bought you an Ice-cream to quench your thirst.

 As you commence your assault on this delicious gift. You go for the last scoop of screen on the “Top” of the cone to the bottom like a normal person not like aunt Barry that eat the bottom of the ice cream cone first.

  Thus, following the principle of "Last in, First out".

A stack is a linear data structure in which elements can be inserted and deleted only from one side of the list, called the top. A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last is the first element to come out. 
The insertion of an element into stack is called push operation [just as we use the Push  method in javascript], and deletion of an element from the stack is called pop operation [just as we use the POP  method in javascript].
 In stack we always keep track of the last element present in the list with a pointer called top. Simply put, items that were inserted last would automatically be on the top of the Stack.


# **STACKS**

Stack half brother “Queue" is a linear data structure as well, 
however, queue follows a different  principle formally know as (FIFO (First In First Out)). 

#### Layman terms (Just like the  queue at a Walmart store,)#### 

it wasn’t long ago that some of you reading this we're fighting at Walmart over paper towel.(yes!!! you know yourself, I saw you)lol.

  For the sanity of everyone, Walmart enforced the queue in Line rule at least in my area. This is a process where everyone stand in line and services is render based on "First come, First serve bases". The scenario i  just described is the “Queue" format that  all our computers uses.  You can see this in action when you have a back log of unprinted work on your computer.

when your printer comes back on line, the first document sent to the printer to print would be printed first, then followed by the next document. 



In case of Queue, Its elements can be inserted only from one side of the list called rear, and the elements can be deleted only from the other side called the front. The queue data structure follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, i.e. the element inserted at first in the list, is the first element to be removed from the list. 

The insertion of an element in a queue is called an enqueue operation and the deletion of an element is called a dequeue operation. In queue we always maintain two pointers, one pointing to the element which was inserted at the first and still present in the list with the front pointer and the second pointer pointing to the element inserted at the last with the rear pointer.


In Conclusion, This is just a quick over view of how Stacks and Queues works in programming with non-coders in mind. Feel free to share your thoughts.
