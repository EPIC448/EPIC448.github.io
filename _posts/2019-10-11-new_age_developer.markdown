Gone are those days when the best developers are the guys in the corner of a basement, running code through a server with his glasses up on his nose. Some of the best developers I've met in my programming journey are what can be referred to as the New Age Developer. This kind of developer cannot be labeled or stereotyped even if you try. Case in point, a buddy of mine who is data engineer by day  enjoys the outdoors, Netflix, and a talented Bachata dancers. 

Another case study is myself. When I was new to the development world, I assumed only “Nerds” do computer work. That was until my computer broke and I found myself dishing out thousands of dollars to some guy to fix my computer. As I conversed with the computer guy, it turns out he makes websites as a side hustle. The last profession I would consider him to be in. He defies all “Computer Nerd” images I built up in my head. As I got to know my new friend, it turns out that he goes bike riding with friends, hanging out at the beach and is of the Samoan heritage. I can't say for you, but none of the above fit  geeky computer stereotype I had in mind.

Of course, I queried him about the cost of making a website. Without missing a beat he responded, it's only $5000. I almost fell over from my chair with a puzzled look of amazement. A light bulb went off as I pieced together the fact that my new computer friend can make $5000 dollars in a weekend as a developer and you can't even tell he makes that type of income as he is a regular looking guy with sandals who enjoys hanging out with friends and family like myself. Again, image shattered.

Back to the subject. Developers cannot be grouped or stereotyped because as we all have lives outside of coding and come from different backgrounds. However, some of the best developers I have met were moms, soccer players, MMA fighter but they all seem to have several common traits. Let's talk about those traits. 

Characteristics of a New Age Developer: 

1. Does not know it all. All true developer can testify that they get stuck once in a while too. No one person knows it all. And the sooner you understand this. You open up a world of endless possibility. 

2. They ask for help. Trust me, this was a big  challenge for me as I have a science background. As a lab rat, what you know is what you know and no one questions you. However, for a true developer, asking for help goes a long way in your learning. 

3. They’re ok with the unknown. Only if I had a dollar for every time I attempted to find out how each “gem” in my app works. I could possibly payoff my college student loan in 3 months. 
Listen “SHERLOCK, someone else did the heavy lifting for you”, let it be. Don't try to demystify every problem or gems.

4. 10-12 hour daily coding is a Myth. The human brain is not a machine, thus it needs to rest. In my case, I code a total of 3-5 hours daily except Sunday,  on top of a job and growing a business.. I had to break my sessions into 25 minutes code session, with 10 minutes breaks in between. This helps me understand and connect with  information more and easier. It may seem like you’re doing less , but in the long run, you gain a deeper knowledge and long-term understanding that your future self will thank you for..

6. Passion for problem solving and teamwork. I can't even tell you how much joy this type of personality brings to the workplace. People that are “solution seeking” earn more in their lifetime, and tend to be happier in every area of their lives. Science research proves this and from personal experience, this is very true. 

7. Health and Wealth is key: This type of developer take care of the most important thing they have, health. You see most people spend their life chasing wealth and neglecting their health. Then, they spend the rest or whatever is left of their life using the gained wealth to chase their health. Often it is too late. I’m not saying to be a triathlon athlete or a gym rat but,I am highly suggesting that we all can do better with our health. In programming, health is wealth. If you don't take care of yourself, It would be challenging to create quality work.
