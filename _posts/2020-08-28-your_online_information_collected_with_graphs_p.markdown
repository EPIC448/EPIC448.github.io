 Note: This is not your Normal Two-Dimensional Graph that your high School teacher thought you. 
Picture below

*So you ask, What is Graphs in regards to Software engineer.*
## Software Graphs.


** Wikipedia Definition:** 
> Graph data structure contains a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points combined with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or set of ordered pairs for a Directed graph. 
      
    ---About now you are asking, what in the world does that mean ?-------

 Let me explain.

-	In layman terms, graphs in software are combinations of lines (edges)and nodes(vertices) a.k.a(Nodes + connections between nodes).

## So what are there uses cases in real world?**

  One words: Say it with me !!!!!**EVERYTHING**!!!!. 

 Yes, that is right: Social network, Marketing (shopping online), Location/mapping, File system Optimization. If it is online, it uses graphs.

 Look at the short Gif clip below.

 For some that are still confused, Let me  **Break it Down**

   *hahaha, not that break it down, I meant let explore areas where graphs are used.*
	 
	 
### Social media:
 A group of people know each other as a result of proximity (i.e. high school, college, soccer teams, vacations etc.) of which we add them to our social network such as Facebook or twitter.  You my friend just created a cluster of people in your social network using graphs.

  Referring back to the picture above about graph, recollect that graph are connected nodes with lines between them. In the case of social media, each Facebook profile or account is considered a node connected by lines which occurs when you add Sarah from 3rd grade as a friend on Facebook.   We can assume that Sarah knows other people that went to your elementary school, that you never met and you know other people that Sarah does not know. Then, you both know people that your familiar with  which we can refer to as a cluster(a.k.a “Cluster").
		
Thus, We can define a clusters as a group of nodes that have connected lines between them.   In our social media example, it would be considered a cluster of people becasue each account is hosted on a  social media platform stored online with connections between those accounts.. 

### Mapping
 It seems like yesterday that we  had to use MapQuest to get to places, then google came out with the Hot and sexy Google Maps and MapQuest was forgotten.

  SMH, Poor MapQuest. 
	
 Graphs are baked into anything online that involves Mapping, as the locations, shops, malls etc. are stores as Nodes and roads that connect them as edges. While the non-techie individual may be ignorant of what happens behind the scene, Graphs baked into an app such as Google map is accounting for Speed, traffic, turns, accidents, and weather on the roads to your desired destination. As you can see, getting from point A to B is not as simple as you thought, but you can arrive safely thanks to graphs.

###  Cross Selling or Recommendation.
 The king of this feature is Amazon online store. We all have shopped for something online only to find a recommendation at checkout that says, “people that buy X product, also bought ABC Product” of which some of us click “add to Cart” without a second thought.   Yes that is graphs at play.

   Another Feature such as this is when you shop online for an item, then 2-3 days later you are in your twitter feeds and an advertainment for that items comes up. That is graph at work. 
  What make this possible is that data are collected on your shopping behavior and used to market certain products to you either you like it or not. 
    
The same goes for Shoes, cars, house, anything else your mind can conceive because they are connected in some shape or form if it has a Digital foot print.

Below is an example of Connected nodes and edges for music Genres. Pay attentions to how they are connected

Not to make this too long, we would stop here for now.
Next Week we will be covering types of Graphs such as Directed, Undirected, Weighted/ unweighted  Graphs. 

Remember, this is geared for the non-coder individuals. So if you learn something, share below.  And if you’re a developer, please suggest positive comments below. 

Cheers.
