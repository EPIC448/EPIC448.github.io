I took the Drop-Box code challenge in JavaScript. Before I took the test, I was little concerned and worried about my performance. As JavaScript is a language I am learning all over again, but it feels so new. Just like any good student would have, I prepare the best I could and practice my ass off for it. Yes that included reaching out to some of my JavaScript dedicated developer friends and YouTube video, the whole 9. Just to take the code challenge and not pass it. It hit me like a ton of brick for couple of hours as I felt like I put my best foot forward, but to no avail. Which is a perfect cartelist for this blog. Failing a coding challenge is not fatal. 

**Back-story**
Coming into learning JavaScript, it was a challenge to understand thus why I used the word relearning the language. Fresh off a project in Ruby on Rails and getting right into JavaScript may not be the best way to learn a new programming language. I didn’t grasp the concepts as well as I thought I did. And one will ask, if you good with Ruby on Rails, why not take the code challenge with what you familiar with. Of which I respond success is outside your comfort zone. I have always enjoyed a challenge and since JavaScript seem to be my challenge in the moment and knowing that it is a big part of the jobs in the marketplace, I wanted to be really good at it as I knew I cant run from it forever. 

**Not a Fan.**
Needless to say, I am not a big fine of the coding interview challenge process in general because it require an potential employer looking to sniff out error in a potential candidate code which in my opinion is not the best way to build a productive relationship in a work settings. I feel the eye rolls already, lol. As some will argue that it is important for an employer to test the capability of a candidate to perform the duties there apply for before coming on board which is understandable. However, as an educator myself in the Fitness and Health realm, it liking telling a potential client to perform Jumping jacks, sit-ups, and Burpees for 20 reps each before we take them into our programs in an attempt to dispel there confidence. Honestly, it builds ”US” against “THEM” mentality and dynamic in the work place. And to add, some people are great at “Faking it till you make it”. So individual may be good test takers and then there get in the company, then it is all down hill. Furthermore, I am not a big fan as it limits the full knowledge of a person. Also, It believes it challenging to draw a conclusion about an individual ability to program based on a “code Challenge” at a specific point in time. However, Most Company do it to Prove a point and test an individual knowledge. Not the most effective method to test a person’s knowledge. With that said, I welcome interview code challenge as some company requires it as part of there hiring process and that it there culture. As a professional I encourage aspiring developers to do what works for them. However, I belief there is a better solution to this. 

**Better Alternative:**

 An effective method that will yield much impact in cultivating a positive employer and employee relationship would be to have a potential candidate talk through a project that there have worked on and possibly recommend there add a new feature to that project in life coding environment. 
Another would be to have the potential employee do their homework by reading over candidate GitHub account or blog to get a better understanding of how does this potential candidate code and develop in there journey of programming.

This recommendation accomplishes certain objects for the employer and candidate:

*  For The Employer *

• Highlight candidate ability to think through their projects and problem solve. 
• Candidate ability to adapt to the situation
 • Candidate ability to work in a self-driving environment and team setting 
• A look into a candidate mindset on solving problems.

* For Candidate:*

• Ability to accept positive feed back
•Cultivate positive relationship between themselves and there potential future employer
• Get a better Grasp on what it would be like to work at the company. 
In conclusion, the purpose of an interview is to check if there would be chemistry between an employer and employee. And truly vet a candidate based on their knowledge. I believe using a code challenge approach shortchanges this goal and tint the ability to discern if there is really chemistry between the employer and the potential employee as both parties may be putting up a front.


 I want to here from you. What are your thoughts on this matter?
