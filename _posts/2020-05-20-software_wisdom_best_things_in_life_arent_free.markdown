Like the song by The Unlikely Candidates, "Best Things in Life Aren't Free”. Isn’t  that the truth on so many levels.  I strongly believe this is so true for most professional, especially  any field in engineering.

 As indicated by the graph above, there is not much else to type or say here. So this would be short.

 Software development is so much like this. I can recollect working on a javascript project of which it  seem like I had all the information due to hours of reading with creating snippet  of code in the language.    It felt like navigating a maze. In other words, I got all the knowledge needed, and I know how to apply them, but It took a while for me to clear out the fog and really connect the dots (wisdom).  I tell you, it felt like finding an unexpected $50 in a pocket of an old jacket, it was epic. Why is Wisdom so important in this field you ask? 

  By its nature, wisdom take some time to be acquired. Just like the song, the best things in life aren’t free.  So don’t give up if the computer language your learning doesn’t click right away. Dont misunderstand me , knowledge is good to have when it's organized and even better when its shaved down to the important pieces . However, it pales compared to wisdom.  With wisdom,  you are confident in your decisions.  Visualize this, imagine getting dropped inside a maze with your eyes closed and finding your way-out. That is wisdom.


**2  TIPS I NOTICED THAT WILL HELP IN THIS PROCESS**

 Patience: give your self time to acquire the wisdom.  Knowledge can be learned, it is like a muscle it grows with use.  The Wisdom part would come naturally.  To be transparent with you all, some of my best ideas even for this blog has came to me when i was doing something unrelated to the problem i was seeking and answer to, Sometimes referred to as a “LightBulb"moment.


**Acknowledge:**  
 We are constantly told experience is the best teacher, which sounds good, but not up to par. A better version of this is evaluated experience is the best teacher, when it is not yours. A mentor of mine said once, “no matter what problem you're looking to solve, someone out there has  already solved it successfully, Find them and get some answers”.

 Acknowledge  where you are lacking in your process of connecting the dots . There are tons of  resources we all have access to. I am certain that if you’re reading this blog, you are more than capable to find reasonable answers to those challenges you face.

sidebar:  In this process of seeking answers, it bears no impact on your self-worth, thus do not feel stupid for not knowing the solution to a problem. Seeking help can actually speed up you path to wisdom.

**Welcome the frustration:**
 I swear , some challenge we face fill like hoarding cats. :). There is always something wrong. 
I would like to encourage you not to give into this feeling of frustration.  It is a sign that you want things to work out. And you are very capable to work at it. I recommend walking away for a while, call friend's,  play board games with the kids. Then approach the problem with a clear head. Seem to work only every time.

Cheers
