Some people will blame the economy, religion, or politics  for the current situation that we are in. And we are not judging them at all. However, I think most people are more worried about if there would come out on the other side of this situation  stronger or deflated.  Based on couple of research, talking with friends and  webinars. I was able to draw some conclusion. Here are some  trends I believe  we all can  anticipant as a nation. Please, keep in mind that this can change at anytime.

***> Self employment :***  Self employed /independent business ownership has being on the rise for years both for the entry level and seasoned professional. There is no doubt this are uncertain times that we are in, as a result most people are discovering that there are not as tight with there company leaders or  people in position of power within  the company as they assumed. Unfortunately, this is no fault of the employee or the company. Covid-19 disrupted a ton of things of which  million of people pay checks is one  among other things. Thus the job security idea is a  “MYTH”.  
  For  a ton of developer in the IT field, they have the option of switching career into a field they have always wanted or consider consulting as a one man band man company. 

**  > Dis-stabilization on the  job market:** . Stock market, Real-estate, machine learning, and brick and model companies took a big hit in regards to Covid-19. What do all this industry have in common. Dis-stabilization!!  It is clearer than ever the important of innovation at this time. Most company are set in there way of hiring and vetting candidate. 
     This companies find themselves struggling with there hiring process. And rather than innovate by using technology such as  zoom, face-time, and even slack to recruit potential candidates. This companies do the opposite by freezing there hiring process and some even withdraw offers made to newly  accepted candidate which is not a smart choice, because it  cultivate dis-trust for future potential hire before they set foot into the company.
   Any company or relationship that starts off with dis-trust is a recipe for disaster sooner or later. This leads to employee not being able to be themselves at work and the mentality of do the minimum necessary to get a paycheck while limiting the wrath of their manager. 
  

**> Economy down time.:** Research show that with  good economy, it takes about estimated 5 months to get a job, and with the way things are currently,  it will take longer. Most professionals do not want to sit and wait on there hands and knee hoping that something great will happing in there job search.  Most people are looking at ways to supplement there income through on line e-commerce business, online coaching, or selling goods and services online such as virtual personal traning and coaching.  Other jobs that come to mind for developers is consulting job on the side to  keep they skill tight to get paid during this challenging  times.

   Do you Agree or Dis-agree. I want to hear from you guys,
