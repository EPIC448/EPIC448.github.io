Regex. Short for regular expression, a regex is a string of text that allows you to create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text. Put another way,   Regex is the configuration of characters or search patterns (i.e, /, : ,"' ", {},[],)  to filter out what you would like to see in  an email . Languages such as pearl, ruby, javascriopt uses regex. 


As first it was a challenge, but once you undersand the purpose of each character, you can chain them together to get a certain search pattern. It also can be used in editing work or search an replace tools. For Example :/ \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b/.  note that each character means something in this process.
