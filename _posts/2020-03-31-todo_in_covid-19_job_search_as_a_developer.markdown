 It is no secret that Social distancing is a thing now. An actual word coined  by the Center for disease control center (CDC) to express the importance of keeping a 6 feet distance between yourself and another person. This can be compared to the likes of InstaFamous, Facetime, or Dm, that came out of no where and became a wide spread phenomenon . Anyway, for most young professionals or people that were let go, it  may seem like a time for worry, hmmm not so fast. Here are some tips that I believe can help us all in this situations as developer. 

***Reach out to friends and family *** 

   Check on those that are close to you, immediate and extended families. Making sure everyone is safe.  Also, it  is a great time to get  up dated on what you all have being up too. 


***Fired? =  New Beginnings*** 
 
Just as it sounds,  for few professionals or non professionals that were let go, this may be a great time to truly find what you are really passionate about . Most people get a job that is okay to pay the bills with the greatest of intention to get something better. Then, 10-15 years later, they are still looking for the opportunity to leave the said job. It is a great time to  brush-up/update you resume because this may be what you have being waiting for.

**** Companies are hiring****
 
Most company are rethinking there hiring process with focus on the importance of adopting the  Remote work lifestyle. Thus, drill down on what you want at a job place and really look at what you want in a job. Also,  this means you got to be ready to let go of some offers that did not check your dream job box. However, if you're in a financial quicksand, accept what you can in the main time while working and look into getting  a better opportunity or even start your own business on the side and scale it as needed.  

***BrushUp on your Skills or learn a new skill***

  The last point can be  connected directly to this one . Brush up on your current Skills. Technology has made accessing important information to the public very easy. With ton of online learning platform and programs, this is a great time to increase your pool of Knowledge making you a valuable assets in the market place.

**** Be Patient and Follow-up  (relating back to the point i mentioned earlier )******
 
 As mentioned earlier, organizations are realizing the importance of Remote work. However, you as a potential candidate still need to exercise patiences and sympathy as hiring companies are currently getting hit with thousands of application. Even if you get an interview with a recruiter or hiring manager,  indicate to them that you understand that the process may take longer than normal . Also, keep in mind that companies use an hiring software to filter out resume meaning your resume  may not even make the call back pile of said  company. Simply put, it sucks a little but it is a good thing. From a different perspective, I wouldnâ€™t want to work for a company that delegate hiring great people to a computer. 

***Strategies your process with a remote job boards ***

 Flexjobs, we work remotely, Remote,co are platforms that focus mainly posting  remote jobs. Put remote jobs  into consideration as you may actually like it at the end of the day . And for those that are home bodies, this is a great time for you. However, a strategy still need to be in place to succeed during  this times.  I recommend dedicate a  section of your home, apartment, or corner to working (assuming you're working remotely). Schedule in advance how your day will go. And Schedule a break time in there as well. 

 ***Last but not least. Your health. ***
 
Make sure that you are doing all you can to keep save. This include but not limited to Washing hands, Social Distancing, Wearing gloves while in public.  Also, taking  a walk, hitting the home gym or some type of fitness workout. This are great to get the blood flowing, adhering to good health  and refocus.
