BlockChain are blocks that contains information with each  block connecting to the block before and after it. Can be used to track or  store anything like valuable like money to medical records, and even personal Information .  when a new information is added or the previous information is alter, a new block is created.

***Let dive deep***:
 So normal Web application connect to a web browser, which is connected to a  server which in tones  render  data, codes, and business  logic etc stored on the central server when a request is made from the client side.  However, In the case of using BlockChain, when  a request is made, BlockChain will go from a browser connected to client side application straight to the BlockChain network itself thus skipping the backend as the server is not needed in this process. 

 For the non-techie readers, imagine a digital ledger system that can be used to store, track, or aggregate information.

Blockchain is the engine that allow Bitcoin to run.  With peer- to- peer network of nodes or computers that talk to each other distributed all over the BlockChain network . All the Nodes on the BlockChain network contains a copy of all the code on the network which are bundle together in blocks that are chained together which make the BlockChain. This collections of nodes work together  to make sure that the code on the blockchain are not changeable making it secure. 

Next we cover the Importance of BlockChain.
