While I'm not the one to post about much, but after much conversation and phone calls over the past several months.  1 death is too great a number to be ignored. During the black live movement, a ton of people came together to share and support their view on this matter on this platform. However, we need your voices more than ever before. Nigerian is burning to the ground.

Not as a Nigerian American but as a human to another, I have seen in person the corruption that over rules Nigerian. Not as a spector, but as a kid that grew up in Lagos, Nigeria for 10years +. Please understand, what you see on the news and video are just snippets of the terrible leadership and the continuance killing and murdering of Nigerian citizens.  I would spear you the horror of live events that highlight this behaviors. 

Worst part is, no one is held accountable, not even a statement of apology to the families of the killed victims or as much as a $1 " sorry for your loss card." This is not exaggerated.
While it may be easy to fold our arms and do nothing, or you may even say I am not concerned. Allow me to share with you a small bit of history. 

### History

When Germany took over Poland, neighboring countries acted as if they were not concerned then the timeline  below occurred under Hitlers command.

Germany defeated and occupied Poland (attacked in September 1939), Denmark (April 1940), Norway (April 1940), Belgium (May 1940), the Netherlands (May 1940), Luxembourg (May 1940), France (May 1940), Yugoslavia (April 1941), and Greece (April 1941).

Just take a look at that rapid occurrence of events.  The take home message is, your voice is more powerful than you know.
