  Antidote: I would encourage you to read over the Article below  before reading this one else, the terms used in here may not make a ton of sense with out it.  http://techuture.com/your_online_information_collected_with_graphs_p

    *We will wait for you….. Go on…*

Alright kiddos, You are up to speed now on the terms and such.  So!!!
 
Remember from last linked article, 
 
 **Vertex** - A Node. 
 
 **Edge** - Lines or connections between the Nodes {can be Bi-Directional-> Pointes both ways}.
 

 But that is not all…. There is more.

**Undirected Graph**: Directions assigned to distance between vertices.  It does not point in any direction.

 For Instance:  in your Facebook Profile, your friends can see your profile and you can see your friend Profile) It is not a one-way relationship becuase you can view each others profile.

**Directed Graph**:  These type of graphs has direction assigned to the connections or edges betwen the nodes.

For Instance: In Instagram or Twitter. Some account are private till  you become friends with the account owner, then you can view their profile .
 
 Still confused…

 Here is a real life case study. 

Click on the attache link for this to make more sense. The average Celebrity has a social media of some type, for this purpose, we would use Instagram.

 What your looking at is Justin Bieber(JB) has many followers including my grand-ma  Sarah. 

I know right…. ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKGegFqRhq3ulRm/giphy.gif) 


 However, JB can’t follow everyone that follows his account. On the flip side Kanye and JB follow each other as there are both celebrity creating a “Bio- directional relationship”. Don’t worry you can look it up .

 Then we have a way of measuring the edges between those nodes which changes the flavor of the graphs. And we call them weighted and  unweighted graphs
 
 
Unweight Graph : When the Edges  has no value assigned to it.

Weight Graph: By default the edges has Values assigned to it .Commonly used in Maps,  Marketing Campaign

 It has values assigned to it.

 
 Okay folks! that is all for now.  Not to make this too long, we would stop here for now.
